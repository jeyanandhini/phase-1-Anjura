 <h1 align="center"> Session by E-cell NITA with alumni Sumit Kumar Sharma sir.</h1>
 
 ### Points I noted: 
 
 🔥 Rigorous practice and understanding the concept is important.
 
 🔖 He knew that he wanted to do something that has him working rather than sitting infront of a computer and doing nothing, So, sir didnot sit for campus placement.
 
 🏷️ Do not let money be the barrier. Get a loan if you don't have enough financial funding.
 
 👩‍🔬 Explore. Be open to change. There is no fixed goal. As we explore, we set new goals. This is the time for exploration.
 
 🏃‍♀️ Don't run after something just because someone is doing it.
 
 🍃 Do not worry about failure. Fail and then learn.
 
 ✅ Do the right things well. 
 
 We are under-confident📉 over-achievers📈. We need to be confident of what we do and achieve.
 
 🍂 One thing that he heard from a professor at MIT that just made a difference was - "You will get what you ask, you won't get what you desire"
 
 🍂 We can have mentors for ourselves but the best mentor is YOU ✨, yourself.
