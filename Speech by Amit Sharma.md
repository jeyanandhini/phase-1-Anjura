👉 A sense of humbleness, humility are the lessons he learnt when he started to study at a place where everybody was the same or of the same capabilities.

👉 Wherever he was, he focused on learning something📑

Lessons he learnt during his journey 📔

  💠  Attitude makes all the difference. No matter how much knowledge we possess or the degrees we bag, attitude always triumphs all of it. Don’t lose the right attitude.
  
  💠  Invest your time in identifying the strengths of your team and leveraging on those strengths. Working with an outstanding team makes much more of a positive difference than working with outstanding individuals. Face tough decisions head-on and make sure we can deal with the consequences. If we delay things just because we are uncomfortable, things will get worse in the future. Deal with things as and when you get to them.
  
  💠  Take time to strategize and put in place a long time work plan and that will pay you rigid evidence.  There is no substitute for planning. It's very important to always have a plan
 
  💠  Spend at-least a third of your time on people issues and networking. The returns are much higher than spending time in completing tasks.

  💠  Spend time with your family, friends and your community. Make sure we balance our work and everything else.
	
  💠  Leadership doesn't come from a title or a designation. It is bestowed on us when we deliver results and most important of it all, when we build trust.

Traits he summarized that tomorrow's leaders need to inculcate:

  ☘️  Successful leaders invest for the long time.
	
  ☘️  Things often take longer than anticipated but we want results immediately. We are to make sure that our skills are aligned for what it takes to succeed.
	
  ☘️  As an individual, he urges us to volunteer for tough jobs, tough roles, tough things because that's where we learn the most.
	
  ☘️  Operate with integrity. Don't take the shortcut. Make sure we establish the right core, value systems and take visible action when you see something go astray.
	
  ☘️  Performance is king. Keep your performance up. Your reputation is going to stay with you throughout your whole career.
	
  ☘️  Empower people around you. We need to have that art of getting people in our team to work efficiently. We need to know what we need to trust, when to mentor, when to delegate, how to combine the skills of the team members.
	
  ☘️  Be open to criticism. Work on and improve those points.
