💛 This session was with NITA Alumni currently studying at Bocconi University, Italy. She graduated from NITA in 2020. 

🍂 She explained how she decided to pursue something that she loves and how she actually reached that goal.

🍂 She wanted to change from Development to Management and she did whatever that is required; wrote exmas related and got accepted into one of the top universities in the world.

🍂 She was a very active student in first year but mostly kept to herself after that and she did what she loved. She did designing, wrote blogs etc.

🍂 She started development in her 4th senmester. She was interested in html and CSS. She did advanced CSS too because she enjoyed it. Then, she went onto learning Javascript. 

🍂 She says to not constrict ourselves to one particular field but to explore, find what you love and do it!

🍂 When she was in NITA, she did not opt for campus placement. She opted for off-campus internships/jobs.

🍂 She further added that if it is an on-campus placement, they will give us training from 4-6 months but in off-campus internships/jobs, they expect us to know everything that the company needs.

🍂 She worked for a start-up for an year and saved money which she is using now for her expenses at Milan, Italy.

🍂 She said that we are to maintain a GPA greater than 8, that will put us at an advantage during placments or anything related.

🍂 If we are to pursue higher studies, we need to have published research papers and good projects. This boosts our CVs.

💙 If we took a decision after talking with our parents to study abroad, she suggested that we start early and prepare for exams related and spend atleast an hour a day or a day a week solely for that.

💙 We are to write GRE or TOFL exam if we don't have engligh as our first language. If we are able to pass the exams applying for universities is totally our choice.

### ✨Gist of the whole session is to remember that

If she can do it, I can too!!!🔥

We need to do our own reasearch according to our requirements, financial restraints and whatever that is stopping us from going for it 📑
