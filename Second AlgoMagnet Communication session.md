# Second AlgoMagnet Communication session

Theme: 75th Independence day.

Phrase of the day: "Inches make champions"

Meaning: Every small contributes to the success.

Everyone did great.

Had a proper session following the procedure; session after session.

Everyone came up and it was a session where we all were able to learn atleast one thing about ourselves that we need to change or that needs to be polished to be perfected.

The meeting ended on a good note.

I feel like we grew together as a team while developing ourselves as an individual too cause inches make champions.
