# **_The Start-up Sequence_**

#### From the moment you press the power button, a whirlwind of tasks happen inside your computer.

* The CPU starts and fetches instructions into RAM from the BIOS, which is stored in the ROM.
* The BIOS starts the monitor and keyboard, and does some basic checks to make sure the computer is working properly. For example, it will look for the RAM.
* The BIOS then starts the boot sequence. It will look for the operating system.
* If you donâ€™t change any of the settings, the BIOS will fetch the operating system from the hard drive and load it into the RAM.
* The BIOS then transfers control to the operating system.

1. CPU
   - The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is a large chip inside the computer.
   - This is the brains of the computer: it controls everything.
   - It works by reading instructions and data from RAM, performing an instruction, and then writing the data back to RAM.
   -  Some of the instructions may involve other components like the hard drive, but the CPU is in control. 

2. RAM
   -  (Random Access Memory) temporarily stores data while your computer is running.
   -  RAM is both readable and writable. You can add, change and delete data stored in RAM.
   -  It is volatile. When the computer is switched off, all the data stored in RAM is lost.
   -  It is fast.

3. ROM
   - ROM stands for Read-Only Memory
   - It is a chip containing data installed by the manufacturer that is not typically replaced or upgraded
   - It stores the BIOS.

4. Hard drive
   - The hard drive (sometimes called the hard disk) is the main storage device in your computer.
   -  Like RAM, it can be added to and changed, and like ROM it is non-volatile, but it is slow.

5. BIOS
    - BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System
    - The BIOS is stored in the ROM
    - It contains all the basic code for controlling your computer hardware
    - After the startup sequence is complete, and control has gone to the operating system, the BIOS does very little.
