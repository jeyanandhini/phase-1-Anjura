# **_Why is Silicon Valley called Silicon Valley?_**

* Silicon Valley is called Silicon Valley because of sand.

* As a term it first appeared on the cover of the January 11th edition of Electronic News Magazine in 1971.

* Don Hoefler a journalist for the publication had titled a three part series examining the history of the semiconductor “Silicon Valley U.S.A.” The term rapidly became associated with technology, in such a way that the two are now almost inseparable. 

* Many companies manufacturing computer chips (like Intel) were either operating or headquartered throughout the region, now known as Silicon Valley back, in 1971.
 
* The first ingredient in the manufacturing process of computer chips happens to be – sand.

* Making a C.P.U is a different process.

 * Manufacturers first take silica sand and heat it up.

 * When making glass the glassmaker will first take sand, put it in a crucible and heat it(usually over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit).
      The melted sand is then shaped, blown and cooled, resulting in glass.

* The same process is the first step in creating a C.P.U. Silica sand is melted down and formed into an extremely pure mono-crystal.

* The crystal is then cut into extremely thin wafers that are anywhere from one to twelve inches in diameter.

* The wafer is polished and cleaned of any impurities.

* Wafers are meant to hold thousands of very small transistors.

* Transistors are at the foundation of electronic computing and they are very tiny on off switches, like a light switch.

* The process of putting transistors on silicon wafers is a complex chemical one.

* The result the process is a wafer filled with transistors.

* Wafers are then tested for functionality and working sets of transistor are cut from it.

* These tiny rectangles, filled with transistors are the basis of your Central Processing Unit.

* The chip is then packaged in a housing that allows it to connect to your computer.

### Silicon Valley takes its name from the large population of companies doing this work, headquartered or operating in the San Francisco Bay area.
