🗣️  Ask questions!!

💡  Question everything and treat everyone the same, only then, we can ask questions without any restrictions.

💡  We learnt to not question our elders but put a stop to it and ask every small question you have. Ask with respect.

💡  He discussed about one obstacle to innovation and that is, the fear of failure. 

💡 We are to overcome this fear, exlpore and experiment. This makes us innovation driven.
