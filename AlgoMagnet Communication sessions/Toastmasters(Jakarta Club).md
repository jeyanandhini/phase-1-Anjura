### Theme: *Self-Mastery*

* Self mastery is the ability to control one's own desires or impulses. It becomes the ultimate test of one's character. While dealing with heavy bombard of distraction and instant gratification, can we stay on track on our purpose to reach our dreams and goal?

### Word of the day: *Determination*

* Meaning - The quality of being determined; firmness of purpose.

## Things I learnt from the prepared speeches and the Educational speech:
 
1. Whenever we feel like we can't do it or are concerned about not being able to do something, just do it! 
2. Just go for whatever that is. You are to believe in yourself. Nobody does that for you.
3. Always spare time to think about what and how you can accomplish the task or project given to you.
4. Do it first, even if we are not confident.

### There are five steps to cultivate our personal mastery.

▶️ **Step 1** : *Self - awareness* - We should be aware of what we are capable of doing and what is our limit. Only we can control oueselves and this is something that should come from inside of us.

▶️ **Step 2** : *Self - management* - Work on things that we need to improve. inorder to reach somewhere, we need to know whare we are at the moment.

▶️ **Step 3**: *Social awareness* - We should be aware of our surroundings. It is impossible to achieve anything alone.

▶️ **Step 4**: *Relationship management* - We need support and motivation to work diligent and overcome hurdles, so , we need to maintain relationships with people that will help us grow.

▶️ **Step 5**: *Emotional Intelligence* -  Being self-motivated and having empathy while working or in a team/community will help us master in everything we are determined to achieve.
