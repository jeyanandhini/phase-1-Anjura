# ðŸŒŸIntroduction

C was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at AT & T's Bell Laboratories of USA.

Learning C makes learning other languages easier. Languages like C++, Java require basic knowledge on programming.
So, learning C and then moving on to learning other languages becomes easier.

Learning a language is done through a number of steps and in C, the steps are:

    Learning about the alphabets, numbers and special symbols that are used in C.
    
    Using these alphabets, numbers and special symbols to construct constants, variables and keywords.
    
    Combining the constants, variables and keywords to form instructions.
    
    Combining a group of instructions to form a program.
    
# âœ¨The C Character set
The alphabets, digits and special symbols are the character set.

    Aplabets - A,B.....Y,Z
               a,b.....y,z
               
    Digits - 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
    
    Special symbols - !,@,#,$,%,^,&,* etc
    
Constants: An entity that doesn't change. Often known as literals.

Variables: An entity that may change.

Keywords: A word that carries a special meaning. Predefined i.e, whose meaning has already been explained to the C compiler.

# Constants

Clssified into primary and secondary constants.

The primary constants include:
    
    Integer Constant
    
    Real Constant-often called as floating point constants
    
    Character Constant-enclosed within single inverted commas.
    
# Comments

Can be sinlge line or multiple line. Helpful to clarify the purpose of a progt=ram or the purpose of a particular statement in the program.

// Single line comment 

/* Multiple line comments */

# main()
It is a function. A function is a container for a set of statements.

# printf()
A library function which is used to display output on the screen

format specifiers:

     %f - printing real values
     
     %d - printing integer values
     
     %c - printing character values
     
# scanf()
Recives the values from the keyboard. Ampersand(&) is used. '&' is an "Address Of" Operator.
